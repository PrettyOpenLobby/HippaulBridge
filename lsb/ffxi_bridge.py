"""POL-native FFXI -> LandSandBoat login bridge (session-injecting relay).

WHAT THIS IS
------------
The retail FFXI client, launched from the PlayOnline Viewer, connects to its
lobby host (ffxi00.pol.com -> us) on the VIEW (54001) and DATA (54230) ports and
speaks the plaintext "IXFF" lobby protocol. LandSandBoat's view/data servers
speak that SAME plaintext protocol -- the only thing the retail client does NOT
do is LSB's TLS+JSON auth on 54231 (that is xiloader's job, out of band).

xiloader solves this client-side: it hooks the client's send(), and for every
lobby packet ([4:8]=="IXFF") overwrites the 16-byte identifer at offset 12 with
the sessionHash it got from the TLS auth (xiloader main.cpp Mine_send). LSB's
view/data servers then look that hash up in the per-IP authenticated-session map
(loginHelpers::getHashFromPacket reads data+12, 16 bytes).

This does the SAME THING server-side, so the real POL Viewer boot works with no
client patching:
  1. Do LSB's TLS+JSON auth ourselves (as a mapped LSB account) -> account_id +
     16-byte sessionHash. This registers a session in LSB keyed by (OUR ip, hash).
  2. Listen where the client dials (54001 view, 54230 data), and for each client
     connection open a socket to LSB's real view/data.
  3. Relay bytes both ways. On client->LSB, rewrite [12:28] of every IXFF packet
     to the sessionHash. On LSB->client, pass through.
Because our auth AND our view/data connections to LSB all originate from this
process's IP, LSB sees a consistent IP and accepts the injected session.

THE CONTENT-ID TRANSLATION (the POL-0001 fix)
---------------------------------------------
The retail lobby's `ffxi_id` field **is the PlayOnline Content ID**, and it is a
DIFFERENT number from the world's character id. LSB's own char-list comment says
so without meaning to:

    uint32 contentId = charId;   // "Reusing the character ID as the content ID"
    uint16 charIdMain  = charId & 0xFFFF;        \\ "The character ID is made up
    uint8  charIdExtra = (charId >> 16) & 0xFF;  / of two parts totalling 24 bits"

i.e. `ffxi_id` (32-bit) is the Content ID and `ffxi_id_world` + `ffxi_id_world_tbl`
(24-bit) is the world character id. With xiloader there is no PlayOnline, so LSB
puts the charid in both and nothing notices.

The real POL Viewer DOES notice. It holds its own Content ID for FFXI (the core
stack mints SE-shaped 8-digit serials in `accounts.allocate_content_id`;
accounts from older builds may hold 10-digit computed ids, and both shapes
arrive here as whatever `handle_content` holds -- this file never computes
one), served over the 1:3
`KGetChrList`; after a character is created it reconciles the lobby's char list
against that record and fails when no entry carries its Content ID -- the
"writing character data to PlayOnline" step, POL-0001.

So this bridge translates, which is exactly its job:

    LSB -> client   0x20 char list, 0x0B next-login:  ffxi_id  charid -> ContentID
    client -> LSB   0x07 select, 0x14 delete, 0x28 rename: ffxi_id ContentID -> charid

`ffxi_id_world` / `ffxi_id_world_tbl` are NEVER touched, and that is what makes
this safe for the world handoff: the client builds the world-login packet's
`UniqueNo` (0x00A) from those, not from `ffxi_id`, and LSB's map server looks
`chars.charid` up by `UniqueNo` (map_networking.cpp:247). Rewriting `ffxi_id`
therefore cannot reach the map server.

Every LSB->client lobby packet carries an MD5 over itself with the 16-byte
identifer field zeroed (`md5(pkt, hash, packet_size)` then `copyHashIntoPacket`),
so a rewritten reply is re-signed the same way -- see `resign()`.

One LSB account per POL member; character select and the world handoff are
live-proven. Offline pins: tools/ffxi_bridge_test.py,
ffxi_udp_relay_check.py and the ffxi_idmap_* suites (tools/bridge_run_all.py).

    140-byte stride, `character_name` and `world_name` and the 96-byte

#   2. most recent session overall, with a LOUD log line -- behind Docker's
#      bridge network every client arrives as the gateway address (POL and

    responders.py. POL keyed identity on the client IP until 2026-08-13 and it

    client arrives through the Docker gateway, so 5,328 auth connections shared
    ONE address and
    the second player was served the first's account. POL's fix was to identify
    a launch by the client's own per-launch `USER` token (`_sid_for_user_token`).
    An address is a hint for ORDERING candidates and nothing else.

    Ranking, best first:
      1. **`viewer_open` -- the session is SIGNED IN right now.** POL sets this
         on the auth hop that holds the socket for the whole session and clears
         it on disconnect, so it is the one signal that cannot be beaten by a
         stale session. It had to be added because recency alone GUESSED WRONG
         in the field (2026-08-15): a previous account's session was 47s fresher
         than the signed-in one at the moment FFXI dialled, so the launch got the
         wrong member's LSB account -- POL-0001, no character, and the player's
         own character name reading as "already taken".
      2. then a recent `chars_at` (the `1:3` fetch), then recency of activity.
    Within any tier a matching `peer_ip` breaks ties -- a host-networked
    deployment sees real addresses, so it is informative there, and harmless
