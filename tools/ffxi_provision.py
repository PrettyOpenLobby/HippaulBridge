"""Provision a POL member's LSB account, and re-home an existing character.

One POL member = one LSB account = one FFXI character list. Before 2026-08-15
the bridge authenticated to LSB as a single shared account, so **every POL
account saw the same characters** -- you could log in as anyone and play
someone else's character. The other half of that bug was POL minting one Content
ID for every member (`accounts.py::_default_content_id` keyed on `member_no`,
which is 0 for the first member of every POL ID); that is fixed separately.

    python tools/ffxi_provision.py list
    python tools/ffxi_provision.py create <member_id>
    python tools/ffxi_provision.py rehome <charid> <member_id>

`create` goes through LSB's own AUTH (`login_cmd::LOGIN_CREATE = 0x20`) so the
password is bcrypted by LSB, never by us, and records the account in the
bridge's account map (the ffxi_lsb_account table). The password is derived
from FFXI_ACCT_SECRET, never stored, so a lost map entry is recorded again on
the member's next launch.

`rehome` moves an existing character onto a member's account. It exists for
characters created before per-member accounts existed, on the shared account.

Run it against the running stack (the tools are not baked into the bridge
image, so mount them for the one command):

    docker compose run --rm --entrypoint python \
        -v "$PWD/tools:/app/tools:ro" bridge tools/ffxi_provision.py list

or from the host with LSB_HOST/LSB_AUTH_PORT pointed at a published AUTH port
and POL_DATABASE_URL at the core's PostgreSQL.
