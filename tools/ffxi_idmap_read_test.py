"""ffxititle.world_fields: a torn read must NOT become a sticky POL-0001.

    python tools/ffxi_idmap_read_test.py

WHY (2026-09-02). The FFXI id map is written by the bridge in one container and
read by the title plugin's `world_fields()` in another, which caches it keyed by
the file's mtime. Two faults made an intermittent write race into a durable
POL-0001:

  * The bridge USED to truncate the file in place (open "w" then json.dump), so
    a read landing mid-write parsed `{}` -- world_field 0, which is the
    POL-0001 condition. (Fixed on the write side too: the bridge now does
    tmp + os.replace, like its acctmap sibling.)
  * On any parse failure `world_fields` stored `{}` UNDER THE OBSERVED
    MTIME and returned it. If no later write moved the mtime, every subsequent
    `1:3` was served the empty map -- the failure went sticky, not one-shot.

The fix keeps the last good map and retries on the next fetch instead of
caching the empty result. It also now derives a world field for LEGACY FLAT
entries `{charid: content_id}` (a restored .bak-*), which it used to skip --
serving world field 0, i.e. POL-0001, for a map the bridge considered valid.

This test drives the real function through those three cases. No network.
Needs the OpenLobby core's `services/titles.py`: set OPENLOBBY_DIR to a
checkout of it, or keep one beside this repository as ../openlobby. Without
it the suite SKIPS (exit 77) rather than failing.
